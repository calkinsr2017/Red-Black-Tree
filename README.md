## Red-Black Binary Search Tree

In my Advanced Datastructures course (CMSC420), we learned extensively about Red-Black trees but never implemented them. In this project, I will design and build a RBbst from scratch. I plan on only using my course notes to create a left-leaning version. Eventually I hope to do research and implement a traditional RBbst. 

My goals for this project are: 
- learn how to design and create a Java project from scratch
- Apply the theory I learned in class into a working model
- improve my overall Java skills

## Folder Structure

- `src` contains my RBbst package, which includes the `Tree.java` interface as well as `RBbst.java` and tests.
